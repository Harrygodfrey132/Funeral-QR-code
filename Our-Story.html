            <p class="intro-paragraph">
                As a family-run business, we understand the importance of keeping memories alive. In a world where generations pass and memories fade, it is easy for the stories of our loved ones to be lost. This growing gap between generations means that the cherished moments, lessons, and memories of those who have come before us are often forgotten.

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        We live in a fast-paced world, where the legacy of our loved ones can easily fade over time. Many families struggle with how to honor the lives of those they have lost, leaving future generations disconnected from the rich histories and stories that shaped their past.
